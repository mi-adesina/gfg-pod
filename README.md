# GFG POD Solutions in TypeScript

This repository contains my solutions to the GeeksforGeeks Problem of the Day (POD), aiming to improve my data structures and algorithms skills using TypeScript. Solutions are organized by date (YYYY-MM-DD).

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to:

- Consistently practice data structures and algorithms.
- Improve problem-solving skills.
- Gain proficiency in TypeScript for algorithmic problem-solving.
- Maintain a well-documented and organized collection of solutions.

## Organization

Solutions are organized into folders by date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. For example, the solution for a problem on October 26, 2024, would be located in a folder named `2024-10-26`.

Within each date folder, you'll find:

- A TypeScript file (`index.ts`) containing the solution.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:mi-adesina/gfg-pod.git
    ```

2.  **Run the solution:**

    You'll need Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.

    ```bash
    npm install # Install dependencies
    npm run [date]
    ```

    **Example:** To run the solution for January 02, 2025, you would use:

    ```bash
    npm run 2025-01-02
    ```

    If you want to run a file directly using `ts-node` you can use the following command from the root directory by replacing the path to the file you want to run.

    ```bash
    npx ts-node 2024-10-26/index.ts
    ```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find any errors or have improvements to the solutions, feel free to open a pull request.
